  "ingredients": [
    "1 bag – Baby Carrots",
    "Enough – Butter ",
    "Enough – olive oil chilli infused oil preferred",
    "Enough – chili powder",
    "Enough – cayenne",
    "Enough – sugar",

  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Pat the carrots dry with some paper towels.",
    "Add some butter and olive oil, preference for using chili infused oil for the carrots",
    "Let that simmer till bubbly, the toss all the carrots in the oil/butter mixture.",
    "When they start to crisp where the pan makes contact, stir and toss while adding a liberal amount of salt to further draw out moisture.",
    "Once a nice sear mark has developed on the carrots, toss in a liberal dusting of chili powder, cayenne, a bit of sugar and a healthy drizzle of honey or agave nectar if you want to stay more vegetarian or vegan friendly.",
    "After the glaze begins to caramelize, throw in a dash of dried thyme and rosemary",
    "Cut heat, and let the glaze thicken.",
    "End result should be a sweet and spicy glazed carrot with crunch, but at the same time soft, as they are cooked.",
    "The true secret to making these spiced carrots is both the texture, making sure to barely cook the carrots so they still have resistance as you chew, and the chili powder. A slight smokiness with a pinch of heat, as well as the caffeine in the spice waking up your taste buds."
