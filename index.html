    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm Tori Koelewyn, I'm a firmware developer, west coast swing dancer, and ASL learner located in Vancouver Canada.</p>
    
    <p>toleiko is my consulting business where I specialize in firmware development for innovative companies in healthcare and clean technology. Through Toleiko, I help startups and established companies bring their embedded product ideas to life, from initial concept through to production-ready solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you need embedded systems programming, IoT device development, or data analysis for connected products, I bring years of experience working with cutting-edge technologies to help solve complex technical challenges.</p>
    
    <h2>My work life</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Engineering Physics at UBC where I was aspiring to be a mechanical engineer; however due to available projects at the first company I worked at I landed in firmware. While it wasn't what I set out to do, I love the firmware world of debugging, solving problems, and creating smart products.</p>
    
    <p>Since 2019, I've specialized in firmware development for innovative healthcare and clean tech products. My expertise spans embedded systems programming in C/C++, working with platforms like Nordic nRF52/nRF53 and ESP32, and developing RTOS-based solutions for medical devices and IoT applications.</p>
    
    <p>I've had the privilege of working across diverse industries - from developing therapeutic wearables for sleep apnea treatment at Zennea Technologies, to creating wine analysis systems at BarrelWise Technologies, and in the consulting world working on projects spanning from 3-18months at MistyWest. </p> 
    
    <p>My work combines low-level firmware development with data analysis using Python and machine learning to create intelligent, connected products.</p>
    
    <p>I have predominantly worked for startup companies throughout my career, contributing to products in the medical, agriculture, and automotive sectors. This startup environment has taught me to be versatile - wearing multiple hats from firmware architecture to hardware debugging, data analysis, and team mentorship.</p>

    <h2>My personal life</h2>
    <p>Outside of work, I have a variety of interests that keep me active and creative. I'm passionate about dancing west coast swing - a smooth, improvisational partner dance that combines technique with musical interpretation. The dance community has been a wonderful way to stay active and meet people who share a love for music and movement.</p>
    
    <p>I love experimenting in the kitchen, trying new recipes and techniques. Cooking has become a creative outlet where I can combine precision (much like firmware development) with creativity and the joy of sharing good food with others. You can find some of my favorite recipes in the recipes section of this site.</p>
    
    <p>Woodworking is another hands-on hobby I enjoy - there's something satisfying about creating functional and beautiful objects from raw materials. It's a nice contrast to the digital world of software development, allowing me to work with my hands and see tangible results.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also learning ASL (American Sign Language) as I'm hard of hearing. This journey has opened up new perspectives on communication and accessibility, and has connected me with the deaf and hard of hearing community. It's been both personally meaningful and professionally valuable as I think about designing more inclusive technology.</p>
