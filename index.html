    <h2>Toleiko</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting. This website is under construction currently; more updates coming by Jan 2026</p>

    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>I'm Tori Koelewyn, I'm a firmware developer, west coast swing dancer, and ASL learner located in Vancouver Canada. I have been working in firmware since 2021. </p>
    
    <h3>My work life</h3>
    <p>I graduated from Engineering Physics at UBC where I was aspiring to be a mechanical engineer; however due to available projects at the first company I worked at I landed in firmware. While it wasn't what I set out to do, I love the firmware world of debugging, solving problems, and creating smart products. </p>
    <p>I have predominately worked for startup companies in my career and have worked on products in the medical, agriculture, and automotive</p>

    <h3>My personal life</h3>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy dancing west coast swing, experimenting in the kitchen, woodworking, and learning ASL (I'm hard of hearing). </p>
